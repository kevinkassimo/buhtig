# buHtiG
A small online tool for getting N-th commit (sequentially) of a github repository  
Link: http://buhtig.com  
(Why I registered this domain name...)

### Reason I Created This  
As a Node newbie, I planned to learn stylish stuff through the development of successful modules and framework. Then I noticed that it is extremely tiring to find the early commits through possibly 1000+ ones (and good job GitHub, only displaying most recent commits and leaving a small "Older" button so that I can waste my time clicking it. Don't ask me why not download and use git. I just don't want to...).  
Through searching I noticed a small website called www.first-commit.com (currently down), which quickly finds the first commit of any GitHub repository. SO... I made this so that I can browse sequentially from start.  

### Further Plans
Maybe creating a CSS animation of sequential commits on a tree?
